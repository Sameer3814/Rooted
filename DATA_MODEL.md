# Rooted — Data Model

The full schema for every entity Rooted needs, including the vision features
that aren't built yet. This is a **design pass, not a data-entry pass** — the
shapes are decided here so features can be added additively (see CLAUDE.md
"Design philosophy"). Content is then gathered in vertical slices, one feature
at a time.

**Keep this file in sync.** Any schema or entity change goes here in the same
pass that changes the code or data.

Status legend for each entity:
- **live** — exists in `data/*.json` and the app reads it
- **partial** — exists but incomplete or not wired into the app
- **planned** — designed here, not yet created

---

## 1. Conventions

### IDs
Stable, human-readable, type-prefixed strings. Never auto-increment numbers.
Assigned once and never changed (they're how hand-curated and bulk-imported
data merge without collisions).

| Entity        | Prefix        | Example                          |
|---------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Verse         | `verse_`      | `verse_genesis_1_1`              |
| Topic         | `topic_`      | `topic_forgiveness`              |
| Character     | `char_`       | `char_david`                     |
| Story         | `story_`      | `story_binding_of_isaac`         |
| Era           | `era_`        | `era_patriarchs`                 |
| Life event    | `event_`      | `event_abraham_call`             |
| Motif         | `motif_`      | `motif_younger_son_chosen`       |
| Media         | `media_`      | `media_char_david_portrait`      |
| Connection    | `conn_`       | `conn_isaac_child_of_abraham`    |
| Challenge type| `challenge_`  | `challenge_fill_blank`           |
| Practice session | `session_` | `session_20260903_0912`          |
| Journal entry | `journal_`    | `journal_20260903_1030`          |

Verse IDs follow `verse_<book>_<chapter>_<verse>`, book slug lowercased with no
spaces (`songofsolomon`). Everything else is `<prefix><slug>` where the slug is
lowercase, `_`-separated, and descriptive.

### Open strings over enums
`roles`, relationship labels, `motif` names, `depthTags`, media `role`, etc. are
free-form data. Adding a new kind should mean adding data, not editing a code
enum. Code may *recognise* certain known strings (e.g. to pick an icon) but must
degrade gracefully for unknown ones.

### The `metadata` bag
Every content entity may carry `"metadata": {}` — an open object for speculative
or one-off fields. Prove a field is needed in `metadata` before promoting it to
a first-class schema field.

### Content vs. user state
Content entities (Verse, Topic, Character, …) are shared/seed data and live in
`data/*.json`. User state (progress, sessions, journal) is per-user and lives in
`window.storage`. **They never share object identity** — resetting progress must
not be able to delete a verse. See §7.

---

## 2. Content entities

### Verse — *live*
```json
{
  "id": "verse_genesis_22_8",
  "reference": "Genesis 22:8",
  "book": "Genesis",
  "chapter": 22,
  "verse": 8,
  "text": "Abraham said, \"God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering, my son.\" So they both went together.",
  "translation": "WEB",
  "topicIds": ["topic_faith", "topic_trust"],
  "characterIds": ["char_abraham", "char_isaac"],
  "storyIds": ["story_binding_of_isaac"],
  "motifIds": ["motif_substitutionary_sacrifice"],
  "depthTags": ["intro"],
  "metadata": {}
}
```
- `book` / `chapter` / `verse` are structured fields alongside the display
  `reference` string — needed for sorting, range queries, and the browse UI over
  the full corpus. Emitted by `pipeline/parse_books.py`. *(Live since
  2026-09-03; §8.2.)*
- `translation` stays a string. WEB is the only value today; do not hardcode
  that assumption anywhere. See §9.
- `storyIds` / `motifIds` / `depthTags` are **new**, all optional, default `[]`.
- **No `progress` field.** Progress lives in user state (`rooted-progress`),
  keyed by verse id — see §7. (Done 2026-09-03; §8.1.)

### Topic — *live*
```json
{
  "id": "topic_greed",
  "name": "Greed",
  "description": "Wanting more than enough, and trusting wealth over God.",
  "relatedTopicIds": ["topic_contentment", "topic_envy"],
  "depthTags": [],
  "metadata": {}
}
```
- `relatedTopicIds` is a flat, untyped, symmetric adjacency list — fine for
  "topics connect to topics" as long as the only relationship is "related."
- The moment we want *typed* topic relations ("contrasts with", "leads to",
  "is a form of"), migrate these edges to **Connection** (§2 Connection) and
  leave `relatedTopicIds` as a derived convenience or drop it. Don't add a
  second embedded array.

### Character — *partial* (10 Genesis characters)
```json
{
  "id": "char_jacob",
  "name": "Jacob",
  "alsoKnownAs": ["Israel"],
  "roles": ["patriarch"],
  "eraId": "era_patriarchs",
  "summary": "Isaac and Rebekah's younger twin...",
  "verseIds": ["verse_genesis_28_15"],
  "storyIds": ["story_jacobs_ladder", "story_jacob_wrestles_god"],
  "lifeEventIds": ["event_jacob_ladder", "event_jacob_wrestles"],
  "mediaIds": ["media_char_jacob_portrait"],
  "depthTags": [],
  "metadata": {}
}
```
- `eraId` replaces the current free-string `era` (`"Patriarchs"`) with a
  reference to an **Era** entity. Migration: map existing strings to `era_*`
  ids. Keep the old `era` string in `metadata.legacyEra` during transition if
  useful.
- `alsoKnownAs` is **new** — needed for search (Abram/Abraham, Saul/Paul).
- `relationships[]` (currently embedded on the character) **moves to
  Connection**. This is the textbook case for the generic entity: the links are
  typed ("son of"), directional, browsable in their own right, and will grow
  notes. See §8.4 for migration.
- `verseIds` / `storyIds` / `lifeEventIds` / `mediaIds` stay as embedded id
  arrays — they're cheap, stable, and drive lookups the UI does constantly.

### Story — *planned*
A narrative unit — one episode. Bigger than a verse, smaller than a book.
```json
{
  "id": "story_binding_of_isaac",
  "title": "The Binding of Isaac",
  "summary": "God tests Abraham by asking him to sacrifice Isaac; a ram is provided in his place.",
  "primaryReference": "Genesis 22:1-19",
  "verseIds": ["verse_genesis_22_1", "verse_genesis_22_8", "verse_genesis_22_14"],
  "characterIds": ["char_abraham", "char_isaac"],
  "eraId": "era_patriarchs",
  "topicIds": ["topic_faith", "topic_trust"],
  "motifIds": ["motif_substitutionary_sacrifice", "motif_mountain_encounter"],
  "canonicalOrder": 1201,
  "depthTags": ["intro"],
  "metadata": {}
}
```
- `canonicalOrder` — an integer for rough chronological/narrative sorting across
  the whole OT. Sparse on purpose (leave gaps: 1201, 1202 …) so stories can be
  inserted without renumbering. Not a claim about exact dates.
- Story-to-story links (foreshadows / parallels / fulfilled-by) are
  **Connections**, not an embedded array.

### Era — *planned*
A broad period, used for the timeline and "who else lived then."
```json
{
  "id": "era_patriarchs",
  "name": "The Patriarchs",
  "summary": "Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph; the family through which the nation of Israel begins.",
  "order": 3,
  "approxRange": "c. 2000–1650 BC",
  "metadata": {}
}
```
- `order` — integer, sequences the eras.
- `approxRange` — free string; scholarship varies and we don't want to imply
  false precision.

### LifeEvent — *planned*
One dated-ish moment in a person's life. The unit behind the character timeline
("highlights of their life").
```json
{
  "id": "event_abraham_call",
  "characterId": "char_abraham",
  "participantIds": ["char_abraham", "char_sarah", "char_lot"],
  "title": "Called to leave Haran",
  "description": "Yahweh tells Abram to leave his country for a land he will be shown, with the promise of becoming a great nation.",
  "reference": "Genesis 12:1-9",
  "storyId": "story_call_of_abram",
  "eraId": "era_patriarchs",
  "sequenceInLife": 1,
  "ageApprox": 75,
  "metadata": {}
}
```
- `characterId` is the primary subject; `participantIds` is everyone involved
  (drives "this event also appears on Sarah's timeline").
- `sequenceInLife` — integer ordering within that character's life. Sparse.
- `ageApprox` — optional; only when the text gives it.
- "Parallel events / stories happening at the same time" are computed two ways:
  (a) same `eraId` + nearby `canonicalOrder`, (b) explicit Connection with a
  relationship like `"contemporary of"` or `"parallels"`.

### Motif — *planned*
A recurring biblical pattern (younger-son-chosen, exile-and-return,
barren-woman-given-a-child, water-in-the-wilderness…).
```json
{
  "id": "motif_younger_son_chosen",
  "name": "The younger son is chosen",
  "description": "God repeatedly bypasses the firstborn and the cultural rule of primogeniture.",
  "exampleReferences": ["Genesis 25:23", "Genesis 48:14", "1 Samuel 16:11"],
  "depthTags": ["deep"],
  "metadata": {}
}
```
- **Motif instances** (this motif shows up in that story / character / verse)
  are **Connections** — `fromType: "motif"`, `toType: "story" | "character" |
  "verse"`, `relationship: "instance of"`. No separate MotifInstance entity;
  this is the deliberate demonstration of the generic-Connection pattern.

### Media — *planned*
Illustrations, maps, decorative art. A **separate linked entity** so art style,
multiple images, and dark-mode variants can change without touching content.
```json
{
  "id": "media_char_david_portrait",
  "type": "image",
  "role": "portrait",
  "subjectType": "character",
  "subjectId": "char_david",
  "src": "media/char_david.png",
  "alt": "Illustrated portrait of a young David with a sling and a lyre.",
  "style": "warm-storybook",
  "variants": [{ "scheme": "dark", "src": "media/char_david_dark.png" }],
  "credit": "",
  "metadata": {}
}
```
- `role` — free string; expected values `portrait`, `scene`, `map`,
  `decorative`.
- `subjectType` / `subjectId` — what the media is *of*. Also discoverable from
  the subject via its `mediaIds` array.

### Connection — *planned* (the generic relationship entity)
One directed, typed edge between any two entities. Replaces embedded
relationship arrays. Design philosophy #4.
```json
{
  "id": "conn_isaac_child_of_abraham",
  "fromType": "character",
  "fromId": "char_isaac",
  "relationship": "child of",
  "toType": "character",
  "toId": "char_abraham",
  "symmetric": false,
  "inverse": "parent of",
  "notes": "The child of the promise, born to Abraham at 100 and Sarah at 90.",
  "depthTags": [],
  "metadata": {}
}
```
Rules:
- Store **one** directed edge. If `symmetric` is true (`"sibling of"`,
  `"contemporary of"`), the app shows it from both ends. If not, `inverse` gives
  the label to show from the other end (`"child of"` ⇄ `"parent of"`); the app
  derives the reverse view rather than storing a second row.
- `fromType` / `toType` are entity-type strings: `character`, `story`, `verse`,
  `topic`, `motif`, `era`.
- What belongs in Connection: anything typed with a label, anything carrying
  `notes`, anything the user browses as a relationship itself, motif instances,
  story→story (foreshadows / parallels / fulfilled by), typed topic→topic.
- What stays an embedded id array: plain membership/tagging lookups the UI does
  constantly — `Verse.topicIds`, `Verse.characterIds`, `Story.verseIds`,
  `Character.storyIds`, etc.

---

## 3. Challenge system — *partial* (interface + 2 types: fill-in-blank, scramble)

Challenge types are **data-described and pluggable**, not a hardcoded switch
(design philosophy #5). Implemented in `index.html` as the `CHALLENGE_TYPES`
registry (§8.2, §8.5).

### ChallengeType
Each entry is `config` data + methods:
```js
challenge_fill_blank: {
  id: 'challenge_fill_blank',
  name: 'Fill in the blank',
  appliesToEntityTypes: ['verse'],
  config: { blankRatio: 0.3, maxBlanks: 4, minWordLength: 4 },
  enabled: true,
  build, render, check, score, /* interact? */   // the interface below
}
```

### Shared generator interface
Every type implements the same contract, so `startPractice` / `renderPractice` /
`checkPractice` never branch on the type:

| Method | Contract |
|--------|----------|
| `build(entity, config)` | → opaque `state` object; holds everything render/check need. Called once per queue item at `startPractice`. Must init `checked:false`. |
| `render(state)` | → HTML string. Reads `state.checked` to switch between the input view and the graded view. Must preserve what the user entered once `checked`. |
| `check(state)` | reads its own DOM (it knows its selectors), **mutates** `state` (`checked=true`, per-item results, `allCorrect`), returns `{ allCorrect, correctCount, total }`. |
| `score(state)` | → number 0..1 (fraction correct). Called after `check`. |
| `interact(state, ds)` | *optional.* Handles a tap on an element the type rendered with `data-action="practice-interact"` (`ds` = that element's `dataset`). Mutates `state`; the flow re-renders. Used by scramble for tap-to-place; unused by fill-in-blank (native inputs). |

Session shape: `{ challengeTypeId, queue:[{verseId, state}], index, results:[{verseId, allCorrect, score}] }`.
`startPractice(verseIds, challengeTypeId)` — `challengeTypeId` defaults to
`settings.challengeTypeId` (persisted to `rooted-settings`; chosen via the
segmented picker on Home, shown whenever ≥2 verse types are `enabled`).

**challenge_scramble** — words become tappable chips; tap to place in order,
tap a placed chip to return it. For verses longer than `config.maxWords` (14)
only a random contiguous window is scrambled and the rest shown as fixed
context, so long verses stay playable.

Planned types (all `appliesToEntityTypes: ["verse"]` unless noted):
`challenge_fill_blank` (built), `challenge_scramble` (built),
`challenge_first_letters` (progressive reveal), `challenge_type_it_out`,
`challenge_reference_match`, `challenge_story_order` (`["story"]`),
`challenge_character_match` (`["character"]`). Adding one = a new registry
entry, nothing else.

---

## 4. Depth / difficulty layers

Any content entity may carry `depthTags: string[]` (free strings, e.g. `intro`,
`standard`, `deep` — think Sunday-school vs. seminary). Empty = shown at all
depths. The app has one active depth setting (user state, §7) and filters
content whose `depthTags` are non-empty and don't include the active depth.
Nothing is *hidden* by default — depth is opt-in tagging.

---

## 5. Storage layout

| Path / key | Contents | Notes |
|------------|----------|-------|
| `data/starter-pack.json` | curated first-run seed: 17 verses + 15 topics + 11 characters | loaded on first run; **generated** by `build_starter_pack.py` |
| `data/verses.json` | full parsed WEB corpus (3,994 verses, Genesis + Psalms) | **generated** by `parse_books.py`; lazily fetched by the Browse screen on first open, then held in memory (`corpus`) |
| `data/characters.json` | standalone Genesis characters | **generated** by `build_starter_pack.py` from the same curation; not read by the app |
| `data/stories.json` | *planned* | Story + Era + LifeEvent seed |
| `data/motifs.json` | *planned* | Motif seed |
| `data/connections.json` | *planned* | Connection seed (incl. migrated character relationships) |
| `media/` | *planned* | illustration assets referenced by Media entities |
| `window.storage: rooted-content` | user overlay `{ verses, topics, characters }` | **done** — merged over seed by id at load (`mergeContent`); only written once the user adds/edits something |
| `window.storage: rooted-progress` | map of `verseId → VerseProgress` | **done** — §7 |
| `window.storage: rooted-sessions` | practice session log | planned — optional / trimmable |
| `window.storage: rooted-journal` | discovery journal entries | planned — §7 |
| `window.storage: rooted-settings` | preferences (`challengeTypeId` so far; depth, goals planned) | *partial* — §7, `saveSettings()` |
| `window.storage: rooted-app-data` | pre-split single blob | legacy — migrated once on boot by `migrateLegacy`, then ignored |

> The content/progress split (§8.1) is implemented. On first boot after the
> split, an existing `rooted-app-data` blob is read once: entities not in the
> seed become the `rooted-content` overlay, per-verse `progress` sub-objects
> become the `rooted-progress` map, and the old key is left in place but no
> longer read.

> **Local dev:** `window.storage` is a Claude-runtime API. When the page is
> opened from a plain web server, `index.html` installs a `localStorage`-backed
> fallback with the same shape (top of the `<script>`, `if(!window.storage)`).
> So data persists per-browser during local testing. Reset it with
> `localStorage.clear()` in the console.

Seed vs. user data merge rule: **seed files are the source of truth for seed
ids.** User edits to a seed entity are stored as an overlay in `rooted-content`
and re-applied on load, so pulling a new seed pack doesn't silently clobber the
user, and doesn't silently lose their edits either.

---

## 6. Full-corpus pipeline — *live* (`pipeline/`, see `pipeline/README.md`)

Everything in `data/` is generated. **Never hand-edit `data/*.json`.**

- **`pipeline/parse_books.py`** — WEB Bible JSON
  (`TehShrike/world-english-bible`, CC0) → `data/verses.json`. Handles prose
  books (`paragraph text`) and poetic books (`line text`), grouping entries by
  chapter+verse and joining in `sectionNumber` order; skips Psalm
  superscriptions (`header`, no verse number). Normalises smart quotes to ASCII
  and collapses whitespace; keeps em dashes. Emits `book`/`chapter`/`verse`.
  Knows all 66 book slugs; `--all` parses the whole Bible. Downloads cached in
  `pipeline/.cache/` (git-ignored).
- **`pipeline/build_starter_pack.py`** — `pipeline/curation/starter_pack.json`
  (verse ids + topic/character links + the full Topic and Character records)
  joined against the corpus → `data/starter-pack.json` **and**
  `data/characters.json` (same source, so they can't drift). Validates every
  cross-reference; dangling ids are a hard error. Emits **no `progress` field**.
  `--check` verifies without writing.

Verse text lives **only** in the corpus — the curation file holds selection and
links, never a copy of the text. Rebuilding reproduces the shipped data exactly.

Re-verify the source is still public domain before reproducing verse text in
bulk. This does **not** extend to copyrighted translations (see CLAUDE.md NIV
note).

---

## 7. User-state entities

### VerseProgress
```json
{
  "verseId": "verse_genesis_1_1",
  "status": "learning",
  "timesReviewed": 3,
  "lastScore": true,
  "lastPracticedAt": "2026-09-03T09:12:00.000Z",
  "nextReview": "2026-09-06T09:12:00.000Z",
  "history": [
    { "at": "2026-09-03T09:12:00.000Z", "challengeTypeId": "challenge_fill_blank", "score": 1 }
  ]
}
```
- `status` ∈ `new | learning | review | mastered` (drives the simple SRS
  interval ladder already in `scheduleNext`).
- Stored as a map keyed by `verseId` under `rooted-progress`. A verse with no
  entry is treated as `new`.

### PracticeSession *(optional, for stats)*
```json
{
  "id": "session_20260903_0912",
  "startedAt": "2026-09-03T09:12:00.000Z",
  "endedAt": "2026-09-03T09:18:00.000Z",
  "challengeTypeId": "challenge_fill_blank",
  "source": { "type": "due" },
  "results": [{ "verseId": "verse_genesis_1_1", "score": 1 }]
}
```
`source.type` ∈ `due | topic | verse | character | story` (+ an `id` when scoped).

### JournalEntry — *planned* ("discovery journal")
```json
{
  "id": "journal_20260903_1030",
  "createdAt": "2026-09-03T10:30:00.000Z",
  "title": "Wells and betrothals",
  "body": "Isaac, Jacob, and Moses all meet their wives at a well...",
  "links": [
    { "type": "story", "id": "story_rebekah_at_the_well" },
    { "type": "motif", "id": "motif_meeting_at_a_well" }
  ],
  "tags": ["type-scene"]
}
```

### Settings — *partial*
```json
{ "challengeTypeId": "challenge_scramble", "activeDepth": "standard", "dailyGoal": 5 }
```
`challengeTypeId` is live (default `challenge_fill_blank`, falls back to it if
the stored id is unknown). `activeDepth` / `dailyGoal` are planned (§4).

## 8. Current state → target: migration checklist

1. ~~**Drop `progress` from seed files.** Move to `rooted-progress` map keyed by
   verse id. Update `boot()` / `scheduleSave` to split content vs. progress
   instead of one `rooted-app-data` blob.~~ **Done (2026-09-03).** Seed files
   carry no `progress`. `index.html` now has `content` (overlay → `rooted-content`),
   `progress` (map → `rooted-progress`), and `data` (seed + overlay, rendered).
   `scheduleNext` → `recordPractice(verseId, correct, challengeTypeId)`, which
   also appends a `history` entry. `migrateLegacy` handles the old blob.
2. ~~**Add structured `book` / `chapter` / `verse`** to the Verse schema and the
   parser output; backfill existing seed verses.~~ **Done (2026-09-03)**, as
   part of rebuilding the pipeline (item 7). All 3,994 corpus verses and all 17
   starter verses carry them.
3. **`Character.era` (string) → `eraId` (ref).** Create `era_*` entities; add
   `data/stories.json` (or an eras file).
4. **`Character.relationships[]` → Connection.** Create `data/connections.json`,
   move the ~20 embedded edges, add `symmetric` / `inverse`. Update the
   character detail screen to read Connections.
5. ~~**Factor fill-in-blank into the ChallengeType interface** (§3) before adding
   scramble.~~ **Done (2026-09-03).** `CHALLENGE_TYPES` registry;
   `buildBlanks`/hardcoded practice flow replaced by `build/render/check/score`.
   Also fixed: typed answers no longer vanish from the blanks after "Check".
   Then **`challenge_scramble` added** as a second registry entry (2026-09-03)
   — validated the interface: only new code was the registry entry, the
   optional `interact` hook, a `set-challenge` action, and the Home picker.
   Introduced `rooted-settings` (§7) for the persisted type choice.
6. ~~**Wire `data/characters.json` in or delete it** — right now it's dead weight
   duplicating the characters inside `starter-pack.json`.~~ **Resolved
   (2026-09-03).** Still not read by the app, but it's now *generated* from the
   same curation as the starter pack, so the duplicate can't drift. Wire it in
   or drop it whenever there's a reason to.
7. ~~Rebuild the `pipeline/` scripts (§6).~~ **Done (2026-09-03).**
   `parse_books.py` + `build_starter_pack.py` + `curation/starter_pack.json` +
   `pipeline/README.md`. Verified to reproduce the shipped corpus and starter
   pack byte-for-byte (plus the new structured fields). The rebuild's
   cross-reference validation also caught a pre-existing dangling id —
   `char_abraham` → `char_ishmael`, a character that didn't exist — fixed by
   adding Ishmael (characters: 10 → 11).
8. ~~**Wire the full corpus into the app** — needs verse search/browse UI, since
   3,994 verses can't go in one list.~~ **Done (2026-09-03).** New Browse
   screen (5th nav item): search across all verses by text or reference, or
   drill book → chapter → verse. Corpus is lazily fetched on first open
   (`loadCorpus`), never at boot, and not precached by the service worker.
   Adding a verse copies it into the user's `rooted-content` overlay, so it
   immediately joins the practice rotation. See §11.

### Corpus vs. library
An important distinction the UI depends on:
- **Corpus** (`corpus`, from `data/verses.json`) — reference material. Read-only,
  lazily loaded, never persisted to user storage, not in `data.verses`.
- **Library** (`data.verses`) — the seed pack plus whatever the user added.
  This is what Home lists, what topics filter, and what practice draws from.

`findVerse` only ever looks at the library. Browse results are rendered from the
corpus and marked "in your verses" when `findVerse(id)` hits — the same stable
id (`verse_genesis_1_3`) means adding is idempotent and a re-parse of the corpus
can never duplicate a verse the user already has.

---

## 9. Translations

`Verse.translation` is a per-verse string. WEB is the only value now and is
public domain. Rules:
- Never assume WEB in code — always read the field.
- NIV and other copyrighted translations require a license from the publisher;
  the path is their official API/licensing program, not embedding PDF text. See
  CLAUDE.md.
- If multiple translations land, add a small `Translation` registry entity
  (`{ id, abbrev, name, isPublicDomain, licenseNote }`) rather than scattering
  translation metadata.

---

## 10. Open questions

- Granularity of `canonicalOrder` / cross-OT event ordering — how precise do we
  actually want to be given genuine scholarly disagreement?
- Motifs: hand-authored only, or eventually surface "possible motif" suggestions
  for the user to confirm into the journal?
- Do user-added characters/verses get to participate in Connections and motifs,
  or are those seed-only for now?
- Multi-translation UI: side-by-side, toggle, or per-verse preference?
